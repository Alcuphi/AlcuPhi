      "question": "A small ball with mass \\( M = 0.2 \\) rests on a vertical column of height \\( h = 5 \\). A bullet with mass \\( m = 0.01 \\), moving with velocity \\( v_0 = 500 \\), passes horizontally through the center of the ball. The ball reaches the ground at a horizontal distance \\( s = 20 \\).\n\nDetermine the horizontal distance at which the bullet reaches the ground.\n\nAssume that Air resistance is negligible. The sizes of the ball and the bullet are negligible. \\( g = 10 \\).\n*Do not include units in your answer.*",
