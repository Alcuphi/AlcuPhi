      "question": "A small ball with mass $M=0.2$ rests on a vertical column of height $h = 5$. A bullet with mass $m = 0.01$, moving with velocity $v_0 = 500$, passes horizontally through the center of the ball. The ball reaches the ground at a horizontal distance $s = 20$.\nDetermine the horizontal distance at which the bullet reaches the ground.\nAssume that Air resistance is negligible. The sizes of the ball and the bullet are negligible. $g = 10$.\n*Do not include units in your answer.*",
